Just currently what I think that cpp is a good language for its interesting and not bad-looking syntax.

Begin to produce beautiful and readable cpp code, not as a developer but as a neko.

# Questions

- Empty function declaration occur to object constructor call

As a subsolution, write "void" into parameter in function declaration is thinked as redundant.

In my opinion, separating the obj declaration and callable function is a good way.
